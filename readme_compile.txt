You can compile the source simply by opening projecthelena.lpr in Lazarus IDE and pushing F9 to complie&run.
!!!NOTE: Might not include audio data needed to run the game, download it at compiled version zip/tar.gz.

However, if you prefer command-line compilation, you may try lazbuild. See instructions at http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/lazbuild (Thanks to Akien for the information)
