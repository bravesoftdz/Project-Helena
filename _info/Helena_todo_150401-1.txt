	BUGS
Всегда подсвечивать в режиме "осторожный". И вообще оптимизировать режим.
Can shoot >minimapsize -> wierd behaviour
If bldg-generation x<>y swapped then vis^[ix,iy] check fails
? You cannot attack enemy too far away (further than your visible range) / this will make bots shot from out of sight especially in smoke.
damage is reduced only to 50% at max range... maybe it's fine?
two bots names can be equal
! sometimes LOS(x1,y1,x2,y2)<>LOS(x2,y2,x1,y1); (stupid bugfix made)
! sometimes some mess is left after shot
LOS_base is sometimes set to 0 near wall... why??? / see bug*.png
! When enemy is locked and cannot move and tu<time to shot the endturn hangs up for a while
(?) Range check error 1enemy=HP/3000 bazooka party at enemy turn / could not reproduce
wall tile 4 at high state may cross with map_generation
"holes" in vis far away...
demanded difficulty bots>free area
if select - change y0 position in list of units (if the list does not fit the screen)

Event
A few more weapon types. Optimize weapon/ammo id
Each weapon has its own weapon damage rate - BY attacks, not uses (special cannons may have less than 40%)
Inequippable weapons (artifacts): Scorpio cannon

SCRIPTING
	
	logic:
{$R+}{$Q+}
Technologies
load ammo into weapons in the backpack (e.g. by ctrl-click?)
generate and move enemies in group
See which items lie in a pile (if seen before)
Short-ranged weapons (i.e. acc-100 with min distance specified) for mobs (claws, clubs etc) adjust AI for such stuff
Tutorial mode: achievements[array] = not yet(0) / required+event(1..254) / done(255). If required and action then initiate event [+event]
	general information & comments
	Select/move/shot/end turn
	change weapon/load clip/unload clip/ctrl-click
shadowing by corners. (e.g. target is 50% visible) - reduction of the damage
Use distance^[x,y] to display TUs required
?remember path (target xy) for each player bot for next turn?
(+) click item and click primary item screen to change item / load ammo
click to wait for reload (?)
shot at any map square, not only at enemies. When target is empty then confirmation. Only for explosive?
difficulty increases with lower LOS, e.g. both high and low LOS (including smoke) are dangerous for player.
difficulty estimate for a single enemy must be irrelevant to map size.
try sqrt(los/mapfree) difficulty estimate
High scores
!homogeneous enemy placement at the map 
10% to violate bot homogenity. 1..20 or mapx/3 ---- 50% less bot density.
DIGGABLE!!!!!

	graphic:
??? - thread drawing
(10%) blast animation
(90%) optimize "redraw all"
(60%) modify lists and info only when needed
textures * different textures for different maps
see if copyrect can copy with changed colors/opacity (16 tiles) or should all colors be drawn beforehand (16x16 tiles or more)?
better sprites
scalable gui
smooth wall corners
animated movement

	bot AI:
movement considering other bots or not (for group movement/attack)
Bots with explosive ammo should not blow themselves up?
Guarding / if the bot can move to LOS, shot and return back to guardpoint(guardarea)
bot chooses better weapon/ammo from the backpack if possible and not buisy

	maps:
(+)!!! fixed STAMP & Building- generate from files.
map_generation should give different tiles for different map parts
logical random_tiles for
	eggRe,
	small rooms,
	plus,
	snowflake,
	areas,
	worms
generate spawnpoints[i] / guard
generate eventpoints[i] / place bot[i] at spawnpoint near event[j]
Deform
Combine
TrueRooms / rooms have impenetratable walls and are connected by logic passages (some broad)
Randomwalker (walk N steps at angle alpha (discrete), then turn. rnd*Die. At Die fill walls to be superwalls at passage. Pick random superwall and walk, not penetrating superwalls if random.

	ideas
reaction shot?
energy? walking/shooting/lasers reduced by hits
Different units specializations / character classes / strengths&weaknesess
Different enemies classes / visible difference

	mission:
quests
scripting, messages*dialogs
- clear territory (kill all, %)
- explore 75%
- destroy specific bot
- protect specific bot
- find item
- move from A to B
- protect area
- visit waypoints 1..2..3..4.. (triggers)
